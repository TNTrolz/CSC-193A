        My Second assignment
   </h1> 
   <p>
        Hello, my name is _______ _______. This is my second assignment in <strong> CSC 193A </strong>. The class is completely asynchronous,
        and I believe it covers full stack programming. I am very excited for this class as I am already proficient in 
        <strong><a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started#active_learning_adding_some_features_to_an_html_document">HTML</a></strong>
        and <Strong>CSS</Strong>. I have done my own pet projects to furthen my understanding. The end goal for me was to create a randomizer for
         a game, I really loved. I achieved mixed results, but I spent about 40 hours learning about the full stack. Granted I am rusty on 
        <strong> Javascript </strong> and hope this class will help me refresh my memory! The picture below is the title screen of the game I 
        memtioned. It's a very famous RPG game, and you may have heard of it!
